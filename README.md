This project generates a MUCS-v2 compatible assignment lookup table from an associated Canvas course. 

On an initial run, you will be asked to configure a .toml file with your Canvas information and your parameters. 

Currently, mucsmake relies on this data to ensure that the assignment/lab is submitted on time.
